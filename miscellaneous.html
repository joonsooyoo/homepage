From this routine, I learned to be patient and also enjoyed running which has now become a part of my life. These days, my goal in running is to finish full-marathon at the contest.</td>

        <td>One of my greatest joy is boxing in my leisure time. I have been boxing for almost three years and sparred with various members of our gym. To be honest, I lost almost all of the fights. In fact, my coach at the gym always criticizes me for my poor performance. Nevertheless, I always challenge myself to box with members in our gym. The picture on the right side was an official match between me and the other member of our gym. I lost badly but I am proud of myself to box in front of many audiences!</td>
